    <p>The most common method of hypnotising a chicken is to hold its head against the ground and draw a line along the ground with a stick, starting at the beak and moving outward in front of the chicken.<br><br>
      If this is done properly, the bird will continue to stare at the line for anywhere between 15 and 30 seconds without moving. Scientists refer to this phenomenon as a state of ‘tonic immobility’, which is a natural state of semi-paralysis some animals enter when faced with a threat. It’s thought that it originated as a defence mechanism similar to ‘playing dead’.
      <br><br>
      Chickens evolved from dinosaurs and are the closest living relative to the magnificent T. rex. One lineage of dinosaurs survived the mass extinction 65 million years ago, the birds, so chickens (and all birds) are actual dinosaurs. However, chickens are definitely the most primitive and ‘dinosaur-like’ than any of our modern birds. Just watching them run and some of the sounds they make, (I’m talking to you, broody hen) you can see a very distinct velociraptor.
      Inspired by the flavors of our favorite Asian takeout, here's a recipe that uses canned pineapple tidbits, with the usual veggies. In order to make it sheet-pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container, up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.

    <h2 class="beef">Beef</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Over 98% of the beef animal is used when it is processed. About 45% of the animal is used for meat and the rest is used for other byproducts including leather, china, glue, film, soap, pharmaceuticals, insulin, gelatins.
      <br><br>
      The meat from cattle is called beef. The average American eats about 65 pounds of beef each year. Many ranchers run cow-calf operations. They keep a herd of cows to produce calves. The cows are bred to calve in the spring or fall. Cows, like humans, are pregnant for nine months.

    <h2 class="sushi">Sushi</h2>
    <div>
    <p>While Japan widely gets recognition for creating sushi the way we see it today, we have Southeast Asia to thank for inspiring modern sushi.
      <br><br>
      In the early days of sushi making, the rice used consisted of sour, fermenting rice that wrapped around aged fish – only to help in creating umami, a distinct sour taste. After the fermentation finished, the rice was thrown out and only the fish was eaten. 
      The rice also served as a way to preserve fish and to keep the flies away.
